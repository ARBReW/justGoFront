### Description

Just Go is a user-friendly, innovative web application that allows users explore local areas using geolocation to find places recommended by locals.  
  
The motivation behind this project was to provide both travelers and visitors a curated, 5 stop location itinerary that allows users to explore and get to know local neighborhoods. The app's primary focus is to provide users with a manageable itinerary that can be accomplished in less than a day. When users login to the app they are presented with various routes that contain 5 stops, all within a 15 min. walking distance. Users can choose which route to take by pressing the 'Just Go' button and begin their exploration of a neighborhood. To alleviate the stress of navigating through an unknown area, the app includes three key functionalities to assist the user getting from location to location: geolocation, real-time street view, and user friendly directions . Currently, the app is specific to the Tokyo Roppongi area, but with goals to expand to more locations.   

### Features 
The key feature of 'Just Go' is to provide the user with the ability to navigate an unknown area by:  
(1) accessing the users geolocation;  
(2) updating the user's geolocation to provide a real-time street view as they navigate through a neighborhood;  
(3) provide the user with up-to-date directions as their geolocation changes
